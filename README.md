# Hangman Game

## Description
This is a personal project where I implemented a Hangman game in Python. The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list
- Displays the word with underscores for unguessed letters
- Allows the player to guess letters
- Tracks the number of incorrect guesses
- Ends the game when the player either guesses the word or runs out of guesses

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BemnetAboye/hangman.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hangman
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

## Usage
- Run the game using the command above.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to guess letters and try to figure out the hidden word.
